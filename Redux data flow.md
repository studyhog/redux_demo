# Redux notes

## Redux has a strict unidirectional data flow
1. Call `store.dispatch(action)`.
   Can be called from anywhere in the app, including components and XHR callbacks, or even at scheduled intervals
    * action - plain object describing what happened (action can be thought of as a brief snippet of news - i.e. "Mary liked article 42"):

    ```javascript
      { type: 'LIKE_ARTICLE', articleId: 42 }
      { type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', response: { id: 3, name: 'Mary' } }
      { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Follow along Redux tutorial' }
    ```
     
2. Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it. Store will pass two arguments (current state, and the action).
   Reducer is a *pure* function, it must only compute the next state. Calling it with the same inputs repeatedly, should always produce the same output.
   Root reducer may combine output of multiple reducers into a single state tree (`combineReducers`).

3. Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer.
   All the listeners registered with `store.subscribe(listener)` will be invoked.
   Listeners may call `store.getState()` to get the current state.
   UI can be updated to reflect the new state. If you're using React Redux, this is when `component.setState(newState)` is called.
   

## Usage with React
### Components

| **Info\Component** | **Presentational**                                             | **Container**                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | How things look(markup, styles). User component in our example | How things work (data fetching, state updates). User list?|
| **Aware of Redux** | No                                                             | Yes                                                       |
| **To read data**   | Read data from props                                           | Subscribe to Redux state                                  |
| **To change data** | Invoke callbacks from props                                    | Dispatch Redux actions                                    |
| **Are written**    | By hand                                                        | Usually generated by React Redux                          |

You can write container components by hand using `store.subscribe()` but react redux generated container components have many performance optimizations that are hard to do by hand.
Instead of writing container components, generate them using `connect()` function provided by React Redux.
